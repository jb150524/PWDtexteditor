# PWDtexteditor

### Description

* The task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The editor will be a single page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally the application will feature a number of data persistence techniques that will serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.


### Deployment

* I will need to deploy this full stack application to Heroku using the Heroku Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack Blog.


### Installation 

* Jate
